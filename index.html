      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area but relocated to Georgia back in January 2018.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Good question.  I have a few (and in no particular order):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barbecue</li>
        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Gaming (mainly World of Warcraft)</li>

      </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Not sure.  I'm pretty happy where I'm at, actually.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Woodstock, Georgia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Early in my Marquette Medical Systems career, I built a system known as the Number Generator on a platform called Web Oracle Web (WOW).  I even used ClearCase for revision control of my code (Views, VOBs, branch merges, all that good stuff).  The Number Generator ran for many years.</p>
      <p>I've since done some work in LAMP for personal use.  But, I thoguht this class would be interesting to see how proper modern development is done.</p>
